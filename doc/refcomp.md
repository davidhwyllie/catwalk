# Reference based compression

Catwalk can accept "reference compressed data" which represents a difference from a reference sequence.

An API endpoint accepts such data, which can be generated by the user from (for example) VCF file parsing.

Here is an example of the use of the /add_sample_from_refcomp endpoint, which supplies not a complete sequence (as in a fasta file), but just differences from the reference sequence.  Here is an example where there is an A at 10,11,12 and a G at 13,14 relative to the reference.

    >>> ref_compressed_sequence = {
        'A':[10,11,12],
        'C':[],
        'G':[13,14],
        'T':[],
        'N':[]
    }
    >>> requests.post("http://localhost:5000/add_sample_from_refcomp", json={ "name": sample_name,
                                                                 "refcomp": json.dumps(ref_compressed_sequence),
                                                                 "keep": True })
